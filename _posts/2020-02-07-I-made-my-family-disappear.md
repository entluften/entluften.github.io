So today I came home from school to an amazing realization. I was home alone! No mom in sight! I don't get much home alone time as my mom doesn't have a job and is home all the time. So the only home alone time I get is when both my parents are out doing errands, which isn't too frequent (at most 2 times a week), so this was just amazing!

Then I took off my outerwear and while doing my regular routine where I go through all the electronics I noticed that an MP3 player was nowhere to be found. That usually means it's hidden somewhere and recording. Whatever, it was just audio recording so I just did a very loud remark about how it's, for some weird reason, gone. And after that I kept being relatively quiet.

So yeah, that was a fun experience, coming home and being alone.
