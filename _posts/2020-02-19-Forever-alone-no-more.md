Sorry for not writing anything for a while. I had school break last week and couldn't really write anything here.

Well well... You remember the post I wrote about me being forever alone in the classroom? Yeah... That one's outdated now. We got our seatings changed yesterday, and as it turns out, a table was going to have to be moved. Can you guess where?

Yep, I got a benchmate! Woo! It feels kinda weird that it happened right around when I wrote it here, but I'm pretty sure that's just a coincidence.

Also, there's someone else who's *forever alone* now. Only problem is that he probably likes it. Because now he can sit in a corner in the far back of the classroom and browse Reddit or look at porn and nobody can complain.
