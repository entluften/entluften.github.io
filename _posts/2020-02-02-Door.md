I don't have, and have never had a door to my room. Seriously.

When I first got a room to myself, it was the room in our apartment that doesn't have a door. At the time I didn't mind, but I soon wanted to actually have one.

The first time I really asked my parents for one was for around 3 years ago. I was told that I might be getting one by the end of the summer. Summer went, and no door. Rinse and repeat until early fall and I had enough. I said that I wanted a door for my birthday.  Nothing else, just a door.

October rolls around and it's my birthday. I come home from school, and guess what I come home to? A door!

Well, not exactly. Only problem is that the hinges are on the wrong side. That meant that it couldn't be fully closed nor fully open. I was absolutely livid. I first took the door off and looked if the hinges could somehow be flipped around. They could not, despite the internet blindly insisting they could.

I was furious. How hard is it to get a working door for someone's birthday? I started to complain and demanded my parents that I got a replacement door. A day or so later, and my door's gone, and they say that I'm getting a new one.

That was over 2 months ago now. It's even been my christmas wish and I've still not gotten a new, working door. And I don't know if I'll ever get one.
