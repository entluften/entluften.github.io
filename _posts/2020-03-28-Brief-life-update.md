No, I haven't died from coronavirus. I'm alive and well despite still having to go to school here.

Well, about that... Our country-wide tests got canceled, however. And that's awesome, gotta give props to them for doing that!

I'm still going to try to continue this blog, despite the fact that I barely get any alone time to write here now when corona has kicked into high-gear.
