Hi there. This is Entluften, the place where I can anonymously vent about my life. Enjoy your stay.

## Possible Questions you might have

### Who are you?
You can call me Ref.

### No but seriously, who are you?
Entluften is supposed to be a totally anonymous blog for me to vent about my life without people finding out. I keep my identity hidden for a reason.

### Is everything written here true?
Yes, everything. This isn't some creepypasta or ARG attempt, but a place for me to anonymously vent about my life. I may, however, fuzz some details in order to hide my identity.

### Can I get in contact with you?
Eesh... I have a Protonmail adress (its name is the same as this site name), but I don't check it very often.
